The Legend of the Banana Justice League - COMPLETE STORY

The world was in danger. Cup Noodle and her Tetra Pak army had seized control of every inhabitable corner of the earth. 
Plastic was everywhere. It’s citizens were wading through a sea of stinky trash. They could barely move. But one day, a few humble, green shoots emerged from a forgotten plot of land, and there grew a banana tree. The humble banana: a source of energy, fibre and potassium. It came with it’s own biodegradable packaging, leaving no trace behind on this earth at the end of it’s life. This humble banana had a dream, a vision. He could see a world without rubbish, a world where all food had it’s own biodegradable packaging. But he couldn’t do it alone. He needed the help of the friends he had known since the dawn of time: apple, orange and pear. He sent out a missive, entreating the other fruit to help him with his cause. The friends gathered and stormed the planet, using their magical powers to turn every piece of plastic into a cornstarch, paper or seaweed based material. And ever since that day, banana, apple, orange and pear have been roaming the earth, fighting against the evils of Cup Noodle and her Tetra Pak army. The group vowed to protect the earth from the perils of polystyrene. And the group were henceforth known as: the Banana Justice League.
