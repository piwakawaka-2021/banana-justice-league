<h1>story page</h1>

<p>The world was in danger. Captain <span class="input-words">{{noun1}}</span> and her <span class="input-words">{{noun2}}</span> army had seized control
    of every inhabitable corner of the earth.</p>

<p>
    <span class="input-words">{{noun3}}</span> was everywhere. It’s citizens were <span class="input-words">{{verb15}}</span>ing through a sea of <span class="input-words">{{adjective4}}</span> trash. They could barely
    move.
</p>

<p>
    But one day, a few <span class="input-words">{{adjective5}}</span>, green shoots emerged from a forgotten plot of land, and there grew a banana tree.
    The <span class="input-words">{{adjective6}}</span> banana: a source of energy, fibre and potassium. It came with it’s own biodegradable packaging,
    leaving no trace behind on this earth at the end of it’s life.
</p>

<p>
    This humble banana had a dream, a <span class="input-words">{{noun7}}</span>. He could see a world without rubbish, a world where all food had it’s
    own biodegradable packaging.
</p>

<p>
    But he couldn’t do it alone. He needed the help of the friends he had known since the <span class="input-words">{{time-in-the-past8}}</span>:
    <span class="input-words">{{noun9}}</span>, <span class="input-words">{{noun10}}</span> and <span class="input-words">{{noun11}}</span>.
</p>

<p>
    He sent out a missive, entreating his friends to help him with his <span class="input-words">{{noun12}}</span>. The friends <span class="input-words">{{past-tense-verb13}}</span> and
    stormed the planet, using their <span class="input-words">{{adjective14}}</span> powers to turn every piece of <span class="input-words">{{noun3}}</span> into a cornstarch, paper or
    seaweed based material.
</p>

<p>
    And ever since that day, banana, <span class="input-words">{{noun9}}</span>, <span class="input-words">{{noun10}}</span> and <span class="input-words">{{noun11}}</span> have been roaming the earth, fighting against
    the evils of Captain <span class="input-words">{{noun1}}</span> and her <span class="input-words">{{noun2}}</span> army. The group vowed to protect the earth from the perils of
    polystyrene. And the group were henceforth known as: the Banana Justice League.
