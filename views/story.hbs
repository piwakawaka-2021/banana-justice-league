<p>The world was in danger. Captain {{noun1}} and her {{noun2}} army had seized control of every inhabitable corner of the earth.</p>

<p>
{{noun3}} was everywhere. It’s citizens were {{verb15}}ing through a sea of {{adjective4}} trash. They could barely move.
</p>

<p>
But one day, a few {{adjective5}}, green shoots emerged from a forgotten plot of land, and there grew a banana tree. The {{adjective6}} banana: a source of energy, fibre and potassium. It came with it’s own biodegradable packaging, leaving no trace behind on this earth at the end of it’s life.
</p>

<p>
This humble banana had a dream, a {{noun7}}. He could see a world without rubbish, a world where all food had it’s own biodegradable packaging.
</p>

<p>
But he couldn’t do it alone. He needed the help of the friends he had known since the {{time-in-the-past8}}: {{noun9}}, {{noun10}} and {{noun11}}.
</p>

<p>
He sent out a missive, entreating his friends to help him with his {{noun12}}. The friends {{past-tense-verb13}} and stormed the planet, using their {{adjective14}} powers to turn every piece of {{noun3}} into a cornstarch, paper or seaweed based material.
</p>

<p>
And ever since that day, banana, {{noun9}}, {{noun10}} and {{noun11}} have been roaming the earth, fighting against the evils of Captain {{noun1}} and her {{noun2}} army. The group vowed to protect the earth from the perils of polystyrene. And the group were henceforth known as: the Banana Justice League.
